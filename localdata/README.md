# LocalData

This folder contains DWS Utility configs for various systems as well as kube configs for those systems.  In the case of the VMs (Virtual Machines), the kube configs will not work with your VMs as they are created for a particular instance of the VM.  They are provided as a reference only.

  **All of the files in this folder are developer files and are not required for DWS Utility.  Use at your own risk.**
